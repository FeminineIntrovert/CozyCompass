# Cozy Compass
*Find low-sensory spaces and the gentlest time to go.*

Cozy Compass helps adults with ADHD/autism (and anyone who prefers calmer spaces) discover nearby spots and see **crowd-reported wait windows** in real time.

## ✨ Status
✅ Firebase project + Firestore schema  
✅ Cloud Function (2nd-gen) that updates `places.currentWaitBucket` whenever a `waitReports` doc is created  
🚧 Next: Expo UI (map/list), quick “Report wait” sheet, auth, reviews, alerts

## 🧠 Why
Errands and appointments are easier when spaces are quieter, less crowded, and less stimulating. Cozy Compass surfaces **where** to go and **when** it’s usually gentler.
